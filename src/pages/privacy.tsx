                <p className="mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base">
                    As a Singapore organization, different AustaGreg Singapore Pte Ltd. products/services and Sites may be subject to different privacy laws based on where our entity operates, where the products/services are delivered and/or where you are located. For example, the Singapore Data Protection Regulation imposes certain requirements on some AustaGreg Singapore Pte Ltd. entities or services that are not applicable to all of our entities or services. Where this Privacy Policy states that a provision applies “to the extent required by applicable law,” such provision will be applicable only to the extent that AustaGreg Singapore Pte Ltd. is subject to legal requirements imposing it.

                    For purposes of data protection laws, except where this Privacy Policy does not apply, as described below, the AustaGreg Singapore Pte Ltd. entity that will be the “controller” of your Personal Data will be the entity that delivers the products or services you (or the company for whom you are working or have a business relationship) are receiving or maintains the Site that you are using.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base">
