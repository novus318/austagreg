The foregoing rights will be afforded to you free of charge (except to the extent that your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in which case, we may charge an administrative fee or refuse to meet your request). Please note that legal obligations that apply to our business may prevent us from immediately deleting parts of your information. To exercise your rights, please contact us as detailed under the Contact Us heading below.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>To prevent fraudulent activity, we may require you to authenticate your identity when you contact us. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and within timeframes required by applicable law. Please note that in some instances, due to the nature of the information that we receive, we may require you to provide additional information that will help us identify which information is yours. For requests subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation, we will respond to your request within one month of our receipt of it. We may extend this period by two further months taking into account the complexity of your request or the number of requests that we have received; we will inform you of any such extension within one month of receiving your request along with the reasons for the delay and information about your right to file a complaint with the supervisory authority.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>The following sets out a summary of your rights to the extent that your Personal Data is processed subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation:</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>Right to access, rectification, erasure and restriction of processing. You have the right to request:</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>Access to your personal data. This means that you have the right to request information on our use of your Personal Data. You also have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data being processed at no cost. However, we may charge you a reasonable administrative fee to provide you with additional copies of the Personal Data. If you make your access request by electronic means such as email, we will provide you with the information in a commonly used electronic format.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>Rectification of your personal data. We will at your request, or at our own initiative, rectify, anonymise, erase or complement Personal Data that you or we discover is inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. You also have the right to complete the Personal Data with additional data if relevant information is missing.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>Erasure of your personal data. You have the right to request that we erase your Personal Data if we do no longer have an acceptable reason for processing the data. Given this, erasure shall be made by us if:</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>the Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected,</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>we use your Personal Data with your consent and you withdraw your consent,</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>you object to the processing of your Personal Data based on our legitimate interest and there is no overriding legitimate ground for the processing,</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>the Personal Data has not been lawfully processed,</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>we are required to erase the Personal Data due to a legal obligation, or</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>you are a child and we have collected the personal data in relation to the offer of information society services.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>However, there might be requirements under applicable law, or other compelling reasons, that prevents us from immediately erasing your Personal Data. In such case, we will stop using your Personal Data for any other reasons than to comply with the applicable law, or the relevant compelling reason.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>Right to restrict processing: This means that we temporarily restrict the processing of your Personal Data. You have the right to request restriction of the processing when:</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>you have requested rectification of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, during the period of time we are verifying the accuracy of the data,</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>the processing is unlawful and you do not want the Personal Data to be erased,</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>as data controller, we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes for which it was collected, but you require us to retain the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>you have objected to our legitimate interest for the processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy, during the period of time we determine whether the legitimate interest overrides your privacy rights.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>We will take all reasonable and possible actions to notify any recipients of your Personal Data regarding any rectification, erasure or restrictions carried out by us. At your request, we will also inform you with which third parties we have shared your Personal Data.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>Right to object to processing. You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data based on our legitimate interest. If you object to such processing, we will only continue with the processing if we have a compelling legitimate reason for the processing that outweighs your interest, rights or freedoms, or if continued processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'> Right to portability. You have the right to receive certain of your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller. You only have this right when your personal data is processed by automated means and our legal basis for the processing is performance of a contract between you and us.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'> Right to lodge a complaint. You have the right to lodge any complaints regarding our processing of your personal data with the supervisory authority.</p>

<h2 className='text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-2'> SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

<p className='mb-4 text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base'>We take reasonable technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your information, including applying generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so we unfortunately cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please contact us immediately as detailed under the &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; heading below.</p>
